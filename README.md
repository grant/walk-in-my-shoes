# Walk In My Shoes

> “You never really know a man until you understand things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.”

*-Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird. J.B. Lippincott & Co., 1960*

This is a simple game used to teach empathy. It was created at the Abortion Access Hackathon in SF March 4-5th, 2017.

## What is empathy all about?

Being able to empathize means to be capable of identifying and understanding another person’s feelings, without experiencing them for yourself at that particular moment. It is the ability to literally experience the world from another person’s perspective; to walk in their shoes, to view life from their living conditions and to feel what it feels like to be that person.
